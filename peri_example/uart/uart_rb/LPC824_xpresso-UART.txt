There are two different ways that the UART is used on the LPC824_xpresso boards:
1) The debug port is configured to use the USB host link.
2) Several UART specific examples use the Arduino connection instead of the USB
host link. When they do, the USB host link is disabled.  These examples are:
periph_uart_rb, periph_uart_rom_int, and periph_uart_rom_polling.

Note: Unlike the LPC812_MAX no hardware changes are required to use either of the UARTs.

Method #1: HSB host link
UART:	LPC_UART0
PINS:	TARGET_TX-P0_7 (TX) / TARGET_RX-P0_18 (RX)
Output: Host USB connector (J3)
Procedure:
1.	Connect the board to the host.
	This is done by connecting J3 (USB micro connector) to the host.
	A serial port will be enumerated something like "mbed Serial Port (COM3)".

2.	Connect to the serial port via terminal emulator (TeraTerm, PuTTY, etc.)

Method #2: Arduino connection
UART:	LPC_UART0
PINS:	PIO0_4 (TX) / PIO0_0 (RX)
Output: Arduino connector

Procedure:
1.	Board connection:
	Connect TX, RX and GND from J2 [Arduino Digital Header] to an FTDI Cable.
	LPC812            FTDI cable
	 GND: J1-4         black
	 RX:  J2-8 (D0)    orange
	 TX:  J2-7 (D1)    yellow

2.	Connect to the serial port via terminal emulator (TeraTerm, PuTTY, etc.)
